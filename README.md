# Agricultural Data Analysis

The project looks at analysis of some agricultural metrics for a number of 
countries for the years 2000 & 2005.

The data was obtained from the [Systema Globalis Dataset](https://github.com/open-numbers/ddf--gapminder--systema_globalis/tree/master/countries-etc-datapoints).

It looks at the **Top 5** and **Bottom 5** countries on the metrics of:

+ Land area under agricultural use
+ Daily food supply per person per day (kcal) 
+ Agricultural GDP as a percentage of total GDP 
+ Female Agricultural workers (%)
+ Male Agricultural workers (%)
+ Agricultural water usage (%)
+ Total Agricultural workers (%)

The percentage metrics measure the variable of interest in agriculture
 as a percentage of the entire variable across the country.  
 For example, `female agricultural workers` is a measure of female workers
 in agriculture as a percentage of female workers across all other 
 industries in the given country.
